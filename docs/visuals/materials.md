:::warning
Materials are not for the faint of heart. Be prepared for potential crashes, content log errors, and long loading times.

## Overview

Materials are used to specify the shaders that render the different parts of the game, along with states and settings the shaders should consider for each element.
At the moment, most things in the game are hard-coded to use specific material and may not be assigned new ones. The only way to change how these elements are rendered is by editing their materials directly (potentially having unintentional effects on other parts) or creating new shaders (an old experimental feature no longer officially supported by Mojang). The only elements that allow default or custom materials to be assigned or removed are entities and particles.

If you are not prepared to go in-depth with the ins and outs, material presets can be found [here](/documentation/materials).

## Syntax and Structure

Most materials inherit the settings of previously defined materials, then further building off of them. This is written in the following format:

<CodeHeader>RP/materials/name.material</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"materials": {
		"version": "1.0.0",
		"<New material ID>:<ID of material to use as a base>": {
    		<defines, states, and other settings>
		}
	}
}
```

:::warning
Although it may look similar, do not confuse material format files in packs. There are no namespaces used in materials.
:::

Some material files contain extensive branching trees of materials. For example, nearly all of the materials used by default entities are ultimately derivatives of the material `entity_static` in the entity.material file. If we look at the material used by the current villagers:

<CodeHeader></CodeHeader>

```json
"villager_v2_masked:entity_multitexture_masked": {
    "depthFunc": "LessEqual"
},
```

We can see that the material's name is `villager_v2_masked` and builds off the material named `entity_multitexture_masked`.
Scrolling up in the file, we can find "entity_multitexture_masked" inheriting the settings from "entity_alphatest" and building further onto it:

<CodeHeader></CodeHeader>

```json
"entity_multitexture_masked:entity_alphatest":{
    "+defines":[
        "MASKED_MULTITEXTURE"
    ],
    "+samplerStates":[
        {
            "samplerIndex":0,
            "textureWrap":"Clamp"
        },
        {
            "samplerIndex":1,
            "textureWrap":"Clamp"
        }
    ]
}
```

"entity_alphatest" can then be followed to "entity_nocull"

<CodeHeader></CodeHeader>

```json
"entity_alphatest:entity_nocull":{
    "+defines":[
        "ALPHA_TEST"
    ],
    "+samplerStates":[
        {
            "samplerIndex":1,
            "textureWrap":"Repeat"
        }
    ],
    "msaaSupport":"Both"
}
```

which can be followed to plain "entity"

<CodeHeader></CodeHeader>

```json
"entity_nocull:entity":{
    "+states":[
        "DisableCulling"
    ]
}
```

which can then finally be followed to "entity_static"

<CodeHeader></CodeHeader>

```json
"entity:entity_static":{
    "+defines":[
        "USE_OVERLAY"
    ],
    "msaaSupport":"Both"
},

```

"entity_static" doesn't have a colon followed by another material, indicating that it's the bottom of this inheritance tree.

<CodeHeader></CodeHeader>

```json
"entity_static":{
    "vertexShader":"shaders/entity.vertex",
    "vrGeometryShader":"shaders/entity.geometry",
    "fragmentShader":"shaders/entity.fragment",

                    },
                    {
                        "field":"BoneId0"
                    },
                    {
                        "field":"Normal"
                    },
                    {
                        "field":"UV0"
                    }
                ]
            }
        },
        {
            "skinning_color":{
                "+defines":[

                    "USE_OVERLAY"
                ],
                "+states":[
                    "Blending"
                ],
                "vertexFields":[
                    {
                        "field":"Position"
                    },
                    {
                        "field":"BoneId0"
                    },
                    {
                        "field":"Color"
                    },
                    {
                        "field":"Normal"
                    },
                    {
                        "field":"UV0"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ],
    "msaaSupport":"Both",
    "+samplerStates":[
        {
            "samplerIndex":0,
            "textureFilter":"Point"
        }
    ]
}
```

## 1.16.100+ Notes

Warning for anybody who uses custom materials!

Custom material inheriting is no longer valid and causes content log errors the workaround Is to define the material fully custom with just the prefix and material name.

This was not an issue before 1.16.100.

```json
{
    "materials": {
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "prefix:window_glass:entity": {
            //now throws a content log error.
            "+states": ["Blending"],
            "defines": ["ENABLE_FOG", "ENABLE_LIGHT", "USE_ONLY_EMISSIVE"]
        },
        "prefix:window_glass:": {
            //corrects the content log error. Note: may have to also define the old inherited values.
            "+states": ["Blending"],
            "defines": ["ENABLE_FOG", "ENABLE_LIGHT", "USE_ONLY_EMISSIVE"]
        }
    }
}
```
