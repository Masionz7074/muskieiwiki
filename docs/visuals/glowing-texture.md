In this tutorial, you will learn how to make a glowing texture, like Enderman's eyes have for an entity by using materials and textures.

## Texture

To make your entity's texture glow, you need to open your texture in an advanced image editor (here, Blockbench) to half-erase the pixels alpha.

- Open your entity's texture file.

 _Don't mind strange bones rotation, Mojang likes to render models correctly through animations._

- Find the __Eraser__ tool and set its opacity/alpha to something low like 71 or 23.

- Then, erase the part of the texture you want it to glow. The less visible a pixel is the more it glows, but be sure it is not 100% erased.

Example Pig texture:

## Material

We need to modify the `RP/entity/my_entity.entity.json` file of the mob we want to glow. Now, find `"materials":{}` and set the values to `"entity_emissive_alpha"`. (Be sure to check if the textures are properly defined).

<CodeHeader>RP/entity/pig.entity.json#description</CodeHeader>

```json
"materials": {
    "default": "entity_emissive_alpha"
}
```

	}
}
```

## Testing

Now, load up Minecraft and open a word with this resource pack enabled. Set the time to _midnight_ or find a nearby cave and test it out. The entity should glow as expected.
