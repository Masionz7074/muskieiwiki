## Custom material that glows and works with semi transparency.

Note: this also works by disabling culling so you don't run into those weird culling issues where you can't see entities and things behind the texture the material is applied to.

Note: Texture needs to have semi transparency in it to add the glow effect.

"customblend" is what you would call in your entity as a material.

                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

After some more testing was found out that this only works in 3rd person, but still useful since vanilla blending materials still were broken regardless of perspective.

May be useful for applying to a specific bone and not the entire geometry.
