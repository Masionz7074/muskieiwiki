## Introduction

[Sourced by the Bedrock Commands Community (BCC) Discord](https://bedrockcommands.org/)

In this guide, you will learn how to test for targets of matching scores / targets with the highest or lowest score.

## Get Highest Score ( > )

**Commands:**

<CodeHeader>BP/functions/wiki/scoreboard/players/get_highest_score.mcfunction</CodeHeader>

```yaml
## Get Highest Score
scoreboard players operation .Highest <objective> > * <objective>

## Your Commands Here (Example)
execute as <target> if score @s <objective> = .Highest <objective> run <command>
```

![Chain of 2 Command Blocks](/assets/images/commands/command-block-chain/2.png)

**Command 1:** This command compares the `.Highest` score with every other tracked score in the specified objective, and if the `.Highest` score is lesser than the one being compared to, then the `.Highest` score will be assigned the value of that score. To illustrate:

|  #  | Player | Objective: `wiki:kills` | Comparison with `.Highest` | `.Highest` after comparison |
| :-: | :----: | :----------------: | :-----------------------: | :------------------------: |
|  1  |  Alex  |         10         |     `.Highest > Alex`      |       `.Highest = 10`       |
|  2  |  Kai   |         5          |      `.Highest > Kai`      |       `.Highest = 10`       |
|  3  | Steve  |         20         |     `.Highest > Alex`      |       `.Highest = 20`       |

_No change when `.Highest` score is compared to player 2 after player 1 (since 10 is already greater than 5)._

:::info NOTE:

Wildcard (`*`) compares with all tracked scores — that includes offline players. To compare with only online players or entities, use `@a` or `@e`.

:::

**Command 2:** This command can be modified or expanded. It allows you to run your desired command if the `<target>` score is equal to `.Highest` score.

-   Note: Use `@p` or `@e[c=1]` in place of `<target>` if you want to limit your selection to only one.

**Example:**

<CodeHeader>BP/functions/wiki/scoreboard/players/get_highest_score/kills.mcfunction</CodeHeader>

```yaml
## Get Highest Score
scoreboard players operation .Highest wiki:kills > * wiki:kills

## Tag Players with the Most Kills
tag @a remove wiki:top_kills
execute as @a if score @s wiki:kills = .Highest wiki:kills run tag @s add wiki:top_kills
```

## Get Lowest Score ( < )

**Commands:**

<CodeHeader>BP/functions/wiki/scoreboard/players/get_lowest_score.mcfunction</CodeHeader>

```yaml
## Get Lowest Score
scoreboard players operation .Lowest <objective> < * <objective>

## Your Commands Here
execute as <target> if score @s <objective> = .Lowest <objective> run <command>
```

![Chain of 2 Command Blocks](/assets/images/commands/command-block-chain/2.png)

**Command 1:** This command compares the `.Lowest` score with every other tracked score in the specified objective, and if the `.Lowest` score is greater than the one being compared to, then the `.Lowest` score will be assigned the value of that score. To illustrate:

|  #  | Player | Objective: `wiki:blocks_travelled` | Comparison with `.Lowest` | `.Lowest` after comparison |
| :-: | :----: | :---------------------------: | :----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
|  1  |  Alex  |              100              |     `.Lowest < Alex`      |      `.Lowest = 100`       |
|  2  |  Kai   |              50               |      `.Lowest < Kai`      |       `.Lowest = 50`       |
|  3  | Steve  |              200              |     `.Lowest < Alex`      |       `.Lowest = 50`       |

_No change when `.Lowest` score is compared to player 3 after player 2 (since 50 is already less than 200)._

:::info NOTE:

Wildcard (`*`) compares with all tracked scores — that includes offline players. To compare with only online players or entities, use `@a` or `@e`.

:::

**Command 2:** This command can be modified or expanded. It allows you to run your desired command if the `<target>` score is equal to `.Lowest` score.

-   Note: Use `@p` or `@e[c=1]` in place of `<target>` if you want to limit your selection to only one.

**Example:**

<CodeHeader>
    BP/functions/wiki/scoreboard/players/get_lowest_score/blocks_travelled.mcfunction
</CodeHeader>

```yaml
## Get Lowest Score
scoreboard players operation .Lowest wiki:blocks_travelled < * wiki:blocks_travelled

## Tag Players with the Least Distance Travelled
tag @a remove wiki:eliminated
execute as @a if score @s wiki:blocks_travelled = .Lowest wiki:blocks_travelled run tag @s add wiki:eliminated
```

## Get Matching Scores ( = )

This command compares the executing target's score with other selected targets. It runs the specified command for each target with a matching score.

**Command:**

<CodeHeader>BP/functions/wiki/scoreboard/players/get_matching_score.mcfunction</CodeHeader>

```yaml
execute as @a at @s at @a[rm=0.01] if score @s <objective> = @p <objective> run say @s and @p have matching scores!
```

![One Repeating Command Block](/assets/images/commands/command-block-chain/1.png)

:::info NOTE:

In the `<command>` (where `/say` is used as an example), `@s` refers to the executing entity or player (the target), and `@p` or `@e[c=1]` refers to the entity or player being compared with.

**Example 1:** Teleport pet to owner if farther than 6 blocks:

<CodeHeader>BP/functions/wiki/scoreboard/players/get_matching_score/pet.mcfunction</CodeHeader>

```yaml
## Teleport to Owner
execute as @e[tag=pet] at @s at @a[rm=7] if score @s wiki:id = @p wiki:id run tp @s @p
```

![One Repeating Command Block](/assets/images/commands/command-block-chain/1.png)

**Example 2:** Set plot owner to Creative mode and others to Adventure mode:

<CodeHeader>BP/functions/wiki/scoreboard/players/get_matching_score/plot.mcfunction</CodeHeader>

```yaml
## Set Owners to Creative Mode
execute as @e[tag=plot] at @s at @a[r=16] if score @s wiki:id = @p wiki:id run gamemode c @p[m=!c]

## Set Non-Owners to Adventure Mode
execute as @e[tag=plot] at @s at @a[r=16] unless score @s wiki:id = @p wiki:id run gamemode a @p[m=!a]
```
