## Introduction

[Sourced by the Bedrock Commands Community (BCC) Discord](https://bedrockcommands.org/)

This system will run your desired commands on the event that the world is loaded for the first time after applying your pack.
> Note: A [Function](/commands/mcfunctions) Pack is required to achieve this system, since it is the `tick.json` file which allows us to run commands as soon as the world is initialised.


## Tick JSON

<CodeHeader>BP/functions/tick.json</CodeHeader>
```json
{
  "values": [
    "wiki/event/worlds/on_initialise"
  ]
}
```

## System

<CodeHeader>BP/functions/wiki/event/worlds/on_initialise.mcfunction</CodeHeader>
```yaml
## Initialisation
### Add objective
scoreboard objectives add wiki:world dummy
### Register to objective
scoreboard players add .Initialised wiki:world 0

## Your Commands Here (Example)
execute if score .Initialised wiki:world matches 0 run say World initialised! Pack loaded for the first time.

## Mark as Initialised
scoreboard players set .Initialised wiki:world 1
```

Here, we have used an `/execute - say` command as an example, but you can use any command you prefer and as many as you need.

Just make sure to follow the given order and properly apply the `/execute if score` condition as shown for your desired commands.

## Explanation

- **` .Initialised=0 `** world has just initialised and we are yet to run the initialisation commands we need.
- **` .Initialised=1 `** world has been initialised and we have executed the initialisation commands.

An objective of the name `wiki:world` is added for us to save scores to it so that we can track whether the world has been initialised or not. This also allows us to structure our commands to only execute at world initialisation.

Following the creation of the objective, a score of `0` is added to the score holder '.Initialised'. This will register it to the objective and enable us to use the `/execute if score` condition to run our desired commands.

Finally, the score for the score holder '.Initialised' is set to `1` after all the commands are executed. This prevents it from executing more than once.
