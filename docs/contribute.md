Hello there!

Have you spotted a typo? Got stuck following one of our guides? Want to contribute something new? Then you've come to the right place!

## Contributing

The Bedrock wiki is a fully open source project and is maintained by the Bedrock OSS Organization, and our lovely community.

To contribute to our wiki, you don't need to be part of Bedrock OSS. The members of this organization have experience in editing the wiki and can answer your questions at any time. Please join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/XjV87YN) if you want to get in touch.
