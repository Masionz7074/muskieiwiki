::: tip
This is an appendix page. You can start the guide from the beginning [here](/guide/introduction).
:::

To get the most out of the guide, you should always attempt all guide-exercises yourself! However if you get very stuck, the example packs should give you some valuable reference material.

Download here:

To install, simply unzip the behavior pack into the Minecraft folder: `com.mojang\development_behavior_packs` or `com.mojang\development_*_packs`, depending on which pack you downloaded.
