description: Software for Bedrock servers.
---

Minecraft servers allow players to play online or via a local area network with other people.
[You can download the official Mojang BDS software here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock).

Alongside the Vanilla BDS offering, many community projects exist, in a variety of languages.
These other projects get separated into Custom Server Software (Custom) and BDS-Based.

Types of Server Software:

-   Custom Server Software = Server software developed entirely from scratch.
-   BDS-Based = Server software built on top of BDS, with modifications.

You may observe a significant prevalence of Custom Server Software in comparison to BDS-Based solutions. This disparity can be attributed to several factors, the most notable of which are:

-   The lack of an official server software for an extended period, with the first release of BDS occurring on August 28, 2018, approximately seven years after the initial release of Bedrock Edition in 2011.
-   The removal of Symbols (also known as Mappings) in version 1.21.10, initially stripped to reduce the amount of information, which led to the decline of many BDS-Based software solutions.

::: tip
Since new software gets created all the time, and old software becomes unmaintained it is always important to update this list.
So if you know a server software that is missing here or know that a server software is no longer maintained, then please update this list and create a PR.

## Further Information

If you want to create your own server software/understand how they work, take a look into the [MCBE Protocol](./bedrock) and [RakNet](./raknet) documentation.
