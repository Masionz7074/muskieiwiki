::: tip
It's highly recommended that you have a basic understanding of JavaScript and Script-API.
:::

::: warning
It's highly recommended that you have made the basic textures and models for this guide..
:::

Before we start, let's make sure you have your file structure set up:

Making custom spears is a really simple task. It was not simple for Koala Boy though. There are some scripting involved, but it doesn't do the main behaviors.

## Item

It can go without saying that you'd obviously need an item to make a spear, however we don't use some "basic" behaviors. Let's get an item file and let's add the following components. Let's start with the main components:

<CodeHeader>BP/items/spear.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    //Use duration is the max time we can use the item.
    "minecraft:use_duration": 3600,
    //This component is what gives our spear the ability to 'draw' it like a bow
    "minecraft:throwable": {
        "min_draw_duration": 2,
        "max_draw_duration": 4,
        "scale_power_by_draw_duration": true
    },
    //What projectile to shoot when draw is complete
    "minecraft:projectile": {
        "projectile_entity": "wiki:thrown_iron_spear",
        "minimum_critical_power": 1.0
    },
    //Durability of the spear.
    "minecraft:durability": {
        "max_durability": 125
    }
}
```

## Spear Projectile

We can safely say that we got the important components for our spear. Next we move over to the projectile. This projectile will be a simple entity, with some added components and a runtime identifier to get the correct behaviors.

    }
}
```

Here we got our simple projectile entity. We are missing one part to make this a useful projectile. There is no way for our player to pick it up from the ground. In order to do this, we need events and entity sensors:

<CodeHeader>BP/entities/spear.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "components": {
        //Entity sensor detects if the projectile is on the ground, and if the player is near the entity.
        //This will run an event when it's true
        "minecraft:entity_sensor": {
            "event": "wiki:give",
            "event_filters": {
                "all_of": [
                    {
                        "subject": "other",
                        "test": "is_family",
                        "value": "player"
                    },
                    {
                        "subject": "self",
                        "test": "on_ground",
                        "value": true
                    }
                ]
            },
            "minimum_count": 1,
            "relative_range": false,
            "sensor_range": 0.7
        }
    },
    "events": {
        /*
        This event will despawn our projectile, and give our player a tag, which we will use in our script.
        */
        "wiki:give": {
            "sequence": [
                {
                    "add": {
                        "component_groups": ["wiki:give"]
                    }
                },
                {
                    "randomize": [
                        {
                            "queue_command": {
                                "command": ["playsound random.pop @p", "tag @p add iron_spear"]
                            },
                            "weight": 90
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Once we're done with out projectile entity, it's time to go to Resource Packs.

## Client Entity

We will be using a basic client entity file for our projectile with added code.

<Spoiler title="Client Entity">

<CodeHeader>RP/entities/spear.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "format_version": "1.10.0",
    "minecraft:client_entity": {
        "description": {
            "identifier": "wiki:thrown_iron_spear",
            "materials": {
                "default": "entity_alphatest"
            },
            "textures": {
                "default": "textures/entity/iron_spear"
            },
            "animations": {
                "move": "animation.weapon.default_thrown"
            },
            "scripts": {
                "animate": ["move"]
            },
            "geometry": {
                "default": "geometry.stone_spear"
            },
            "render_controllers": ["controller.render.default"]
        }
    }
}
```

</Spoiler>

Inside our client entity file, you might have noticed that there is animations bound to it. This animation will make our projectile rotate as it flies.

:::warning
Make sure your entity model is modeled like the image bellow!
:::

![](/assets/images/items/spears/spear_model.png)

## Animation

The animation we use for our projectile isn't you normal entity animation. This one uses [molang](https://bedrock.dev/docs/stable/Molang) to define rotations.

<CodeHeader>BP/animations/spear.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "format_version": "1.8.0",
    "animations": {
        "animation.weapon.default_thrown": {
            "loop": true,
            "bones": {
                "body": {
                    //This is some molang stuff. The animation uses this to rotate the model based on its current angle.
                    "rotation": ["-q.target_x_rotation", "-q.body_y_rotation", 0]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Attachable

We will be using the Trident Attachable because it comes with item positions and use animations already. It should look like this:

<CodeHeader>BP/attachables/spear.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "format_version": "1.10.0",
    "minecraft:attachable": {
        "description": {
            "identifier": "wiki:iron_spear",
            "materials": {
                "default": "entity_alphatest",
                "enchanted": "entity_alphatest_glint"
            },
            "textures": {
                "default": "textures/entity/iron_spear",
                "enchanted": "textures/misc/enchanted_item_glint"
            },
            "geometry": {
                "default": "geometry.stone_spear_item"
            },
            "animations": {
                "wield": "controller.animation.trident.wield",
                "wield_first_person": "animation.trident.wield_first_person",
                "wield_first_person_raise": "animation.trident.wield_first_person_raise",
                "wield_first_person_raise_shake": "animation.trident.wield_first_person_raise_shake",
                "wield_first_person_riptide": "animation.trident.wield_first_person_riptide",
                "wield_third_person": "animation.trident.wield_third_person",
                "wield_third_person_raise": "animation.trident.wield_third_person_raise"
            },
            "scripts": {
                "pre_animation": [
                    "v.charge_amount = math.clamp((q.main_hand_item_max_duration - (q.main_hand_item_use_duration - q.frame_alpha + 1.0)) / 10.0, 0.0, 1.0f);"
                ],
                "animate": ["wield"]
            },
            "render_controllers": ["controller.render.item_default"]
        }
    }
}
```

## Script

Now that we've setup our spear, there is no way to damage the spear when it's thrown. To do this, we will make use of Script-API.

The script is really simple, and wouldn't require much brain power.

```js
import { world, ItemStack } from "@minecraft/server";
import { system } from "@minecraft/server";
//This prevents world crash
system.beforeEvents.watchdogTerminate.subscribe((data) => {
    data.cancel = true;
});

world.afterEvents.itemReleaseUse.subscribe((ev) => {
    //This is for multiplayer support
    for (const player of world.getPlayers()) {
        //Basic variables to get the player inventory and held item.
        let inv = player.getComponent("inventory").container;
        //Our itemStack to save our item. This also saves item data.
        const itemStack = inv.getItem(player.selectedSlot);
        //If the item we're holding is our spear, we run code.
        if (itemStack?.typeId === "wiki:iron_spear") {
            var container = player.getComponent("inventory").container;
            //The new item to be given.
            var newItem = new ItemStack("wiki:iron_spear");
            var oldItem = container?.getItem(player.selectedSlot);
            //Here's that tag!
            player.removeTag("iron_spear");
        }
        //We subscribe a tick event to detect when we have the tag and if the item has durability less than the max.
        let e = system.runInterval(() => {
            if (
                player.hasTag("iron_spear") &&
                itemStack?.typeId === "wiki:iron_spear" &&
                itemStack?.getComponent("durability").damage <= 125
            ) {
                player.removeTag("iron_spear");
                //This gives our saved item (newItem) +1 durability each time we pick it up.
                newItem.getComponent("durability").damage =
                    oldItem.getComponent("durability").damage + 1;
                container.setItem(player.selectedSlot, newItem);
                //When we don't have the tag, we stop the tick event.
                if (!player.hasTag("iron_spear")) {
                    system.clearRun(e);
                }
            }
        });
    }
});
```

## Final Product

Once you've followed this guide, you should have your own working spear in-game.
