This method no longer works after 1.18.30.

An `identifier` is a required parameter that sits inside the description of the item's behaviour file.
It accepts Vanilla Minecraft names, like so, `<namespace>:<vanilla item>`, which will apply certain hardcoded item behaviours, depending on the identifier used.

    "identifier": "wiki:totem_of_undying",
    "category": "items"
}
```

:::warning
Not every Vanilla Identifier and their behaviours are documented. The following list may be missing important points about the known Identifiers that do affect items.
