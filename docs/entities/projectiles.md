## Overview

This page intends to document all different fields you can use inside `minecraft:projectile` entity behavior component.

:::warning
_Disclaimer: this component has been mostly documented based on projectiles found in the game or reverse engineering the game._

## Additional Information

When it comes to creating a custom projectile, such as an arrow or trident variant, or something entirely your own, you may want to consider defining a [runtime identifier](/entities/runtime-identifier) to ensure that it acts as intended. Not doing so may result in unintended behaviour, from odd visuals to incorrect knockback direction and arrows that you can kill with your bare hands.
