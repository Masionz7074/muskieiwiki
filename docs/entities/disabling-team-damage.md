:::warning REALMS

This will NOT work on realms, the reason for this is that on realms there is a bug where modified `player.json` files in the behavior packs do not work, and the game just ignores them.

This may be fixed in the future but as of 1.20.15 it is not fixed. This also applies to older version of minecraft as well.

## Damage from Players

If you wish to disable team damage (so one cannot hurt their teammates), assign a tag with the team name to every teammate (I'm going to use `team1`, `team2`, `team3` and `team4` for this example).

Now add this damage sensor component into your `player.json` `"components": {}`. See comments for explanation.

```json
"minecraft:damage_sensor": {
    "triggers": [
        {
            // If you already have a damage sensor, simply copy this object into the "triggers" array
            "on_damage": {
                "filters": {
                    "any_of": [

                                { "test": "has_tag", "value": "team1" }, // Does the player have this tag?
                                { "test": "has_tag", "subject": "other", "value": "team1" } // If so, does the entity they're trying to hurt have this tag?
                            ]
                        },

            },
            "deals_damage": "no" // If any of these filters evaluate to true in the current attack interaction, the target will not be hurt.
        }
    ]
}
```

## Damage from Projectiles

Due to the primitive filters used by projectile entities, you have to use a completely different method to achieve this.

The process uses:

-   Tags
-   Ticking
-   Hurt on condition
-   Functions

If you modify `arrow.json`, take into consideration the component groups.
