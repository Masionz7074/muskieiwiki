::: tip
This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of entities, loot tables, and Blockbench.
:::

In this tutorial, you will learn to have an entity spawn with an item in its hand. I'll be using a custom `mandalorian_armorer` entity and a custom `hammer` item for the examples.

## Model

First of all, you'll need to have a model in Blockbench that has a map called `rightArm`. Within this map, there needs to be a submap called 'rightItem'.
Now set the position of the pivot point of this submap, so it sits in the place you want the entity to hold the item at.

## Behavior Pack-side

Now you'll need to add a `minecraft:equipment` component in the component list for your entity and add a loot table with the desired item.

In our example it will look like this:

<CodeHeader>BP/entity/mandolorian.json#components</CodeHeader>

```json
"minecraft:equipment": {
    "table": "loot_tables/entities/gear/mandolorian.json"
}
```

## Loot Table

Finally, add the loot table for your entity. It needs to be in `loot_tables/entities/<your_loot_table_name>.json` in the behavior pack. In our case, it's called `mandolorian.json`.

:::warning
This isn't the same loot table as what it drops on death. So make sure it has a different name.
:::

To have the entity always spawn with the same item, add the following loot table:

<CodeHeader>BP/loot_tables/entities/gear/mandolorian.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"pools": [
		{
			"rolls": 1,
			"entries": [
				{
					"type": "item",
					"name": "dd:hammer",
					"weight": 1
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

If everything went well, you'd have something looking like this:

## Common Problems

- Held item not displaying

Your entity contains multiple geometry variants.
