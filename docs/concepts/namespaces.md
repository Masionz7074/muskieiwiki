Namespaces are identifiers that mark content ownership. You can think of them as folders. Namespaces are helpful because they keep naming conflicts from happening.

Namespaces in add-on creation can essentially be thought of as "the part to the left of the colon". For example, `minecraft` is the namespace of `minecraft:zombie`. The general form is `namespace:name`.

As a concrete example of why namespaces are helpful, let's imagine you create a new Mob. You name it `minecraft:shark`, not aware that you should create your own namespace for custom content. Next year, Mojang decides to add sharks into the game! Now there is a naming conflict since there are two definitions of `minecraft:shark`. Your add-on will break.

If you had instead used `your_namespace:shark`, the naming conflict wouldn't have happened.

## Picking a namespace

A suitable namespace is unique to you. Something like `mob` or `cars` or `content` or `custom` would be a **bad** namespace since another developer might come up with the same namespace as you.

A suitable namespace is short. You will be writing your namespace a **LOT**, so the shorter, the better. `george_carlin_the_comedian` would be a lousy namespace for this reason.

For personal projects, I recommend a convenient version of your player name, and for commercial projects, I recommend a suitable version of the company name.

Some good examples:

-   `gcarlin`
-   `sirlich`
-   `cubeworld`
-   `bworks`

**DO NOT USE** `minecraft` or `minecon` as a namespace unless editing a vanilla file. Not only is it a terrible idea, but Minecraft reserves these, and it won't even work.

## Where to use namespaces?

In short, you should use namespaces as often as you can.

For starters, you should use a namespace when adding custom entities to the game.

`sirlich:shark` is much better than `shark`.

It would be best if you also used namespaces for components and events. Just like Mojang uses `minecraft:pig_saddled` you should use `namespace:my_mob_event`, and `namespace:my_component_group`.

It would be best if you also used namespaces in animation controllers, render controllers, and animations.

For example: `controller.animation.namespace.entity_name.action` is better than `controller.animation.my_action`.

## Where NOT to use namespaces.

The actual file structure does not need namespaces.

`animations/namespace/my_entity/animation` is more confusing than `animations/my_entity/animation`.

- **Note:** The following folders are exceptions: `functions`, `structures`, `loot_tables`, `trade_tables`, `sounds`, and `textures`.
    - Using a **namespace** in these folders is recommended to prevent conflicts with other packs.
    - **Example:** `BP/functions/namespace/test.mcfunction`
