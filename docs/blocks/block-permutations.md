:::tip FORMAT & MIN ENGINE VERSION `1.21.90`
Before you learn about block permutations, you should be confident with [block states](/blocks/block-states).

When working with block states, ensure that the `min_engine_version` in your pack manifest is `1.20.20` or higher.

:::danger OVERRIDING COMPONENTS
Only **one** instance of each component can be active at once.
Duplicate components will be overridden by the latest "[permutations](#conditionally-applying-components)" array entry.

## What are Permutations?

Block permutations represent all state value configurations that each block can possibly be in.

For example, if you added a custom block with two boolean states…

<CodeHeader>minecraft:block</CodeHeader>

```json
"description": {
    "identifier": "wiki:permutations_example",
    "states": {
        "wiki:first_state": [false, true],
        "wiki:second_state": [false, true]
    }
}
```

…the 4 following block permutations would be added to the world:

| Block Identifier          | wiki:first_state | wiki:second_state |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| wiki:permutations_example | false            | false             |
| wiki:permutations_example | true             | false             |
| wiki:permutations_example | false            | true              |
| wiki:permutations_example | true             | true              |

To calculate how many permutations your block has, multiply the amount of valid state values each state has together.
For instance, the calculation for the example above would be 2 &times; 2, meaning this block has 4 permutations.

### Misconceptions

-   All blocks have permutations, even blocks with no states have 1 permutation that is simply made up of the block identifier.
-   The number of permutations your block has is based on the states it has, not the number of items in the `permutations` array.

## Conditionally Applying Components

The block `permutations` array provides a way of conditionally applying components (including tags) to a block based on its current permutation.

Components within the `permutations` array can override the block's base components, as well as those of other component lists. The latest component list in the `permutations` array takes priority.

        "permutations": [
            {
                "condition": "q.block_state('wiki:integer_state_example') == 2",

                    "minecraft:friction": 0.8 // Overrides the friction defined in the previous component list.
                }
            },
            {
                "condition": "q.block_state('wiki:string_state_example') == 'red' && !q.block_state('wiki:boolean_state_example')",
                "components": {
                    "minecraft:geometry": "geometry.pig"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Permutation Conditions

When evaluated as truthy (not false or 0), the involved component list is applied.

Permutation conditions are written as Molang expression strings, and have very limited context:

-   Conditions are purely based on the block's permutation, therefore only have access to the `q.block_state` query function.
-   This also means that conditions cannot have side effects.
    -   The following math functions may not be used: `math.die_roll`, `math.die_roll_integer`, `math.random`, `math.random_integer`.
    -   Variables (including `temp` variables) cannot be assigned.

```molang
q.block_state('wiki:integer_state_example') < 6 && !q.block_state('wiki:boolean_state_example')
```

## Permutation Limits

As with all things blocks, some limitations have been put in place by Mojang to prevent undesirable behavior.

### Maximum Amount Per Block

A block _cannot_ have more than 65,536 permutations (equivalent to 4 states with 16 values each).
Exceeding this limit will result in a content log error and some states being absent from your block.

### Maximum Amount Per World

A world _should_ not have more than 65,536 block permutations registered (not necessarily placed).
Exceeding this limit will result in the following content log warning:

> World with over 65536 block permutations may degrade performance. Current world has XXXXX permutations.
