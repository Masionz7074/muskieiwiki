Although custom blocks are unable to make use of vanilla [block shapes](/blocks/block-shapes), we can create our own models which follow a similar format to entity models.
This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating a custom block model for a "paper bag" using [Blockbench](https://blockbench.net).
You should learn the main features of Minecraft geometry tailored towards creating custom blocks from this tutorial.

**NOTE:** Custom block models must be within the [model size limits](/blocks/block-components#geometry).

## Model Setup

Open Blockbench and create a new `Bedrock Block` project.

![New project panel with Bedrock Block selected](/assets/images/blocks/block-models/new_project.png)

Now you can give your model an identifier! Your file name can be decided here, or changed later.

The UV mode and texture size should remain unchanged.

:::danger NAMESPACES
Model identifiers are **not namespaced and cannot contain colons**.
Colons were previously used for model inheritance and are invalid in modern geometry formats.

## Adding Cubes

Despite not necessarily being perfect cube shapes, elements in your model are called **cubes**.
All cubes must be contained within **bones**, which act as groups.

First, let's create a root bone for our model from the outliner by clicking on `Add Group`.
Bones can be renamed by pressing `F2`.

The "paper bag" model will need two cubes: one for the handle, and one for the main bag.
These can be added by selecting your root bone and clicking `Add Cube`.

Cubes can be moved, resized and rotated from the top toolbar.
Below are the two cubes my "paper_bag" model will use.

## Removing Faces

Some of the faces of our cubes might not need to be visible.
In my example, the top face of the paper_bag should be removed so that you can see inside.

To remove a face, click on it in the preview and remove its UV.

<WikiImage src="/assets/images/blocks/block-models/paper_bag_top_removed.png" alt="" width="600" />

Additionally, only the north and south faces of the handle should be visible.
You can select multiple faces by holding Ctrl while clicking on the face names in the UV panel.

## Previewing Textures

:::tip
Textures can be created in Blockbench by clicking `Create Texture` and selecting `Blank`.
:::

The "paper_bag" model has multiple pre-made textures, listed below:

-   `textures/blocks/paper_bag.png`

    <WikiImage
        src="/assets/images/blocks/block-models/paper_bag.png"
        style="background-color: rgb(0,0,0,0.15);"
        pixelated
        width="128"
    />

-   `textures/blocks/paper_bag_bottom_fold.png`

    <WikiImage
        src="/assets/images/blocks/block-models/paper_bag_bottom_fold.png"
        style="background-color: rgb(0,0,0,0.15);"
        pixelated
        width="128"
    />

-   `textures/blocks/paper_bag_side_gusset.png`

    <WikiImage
        src="/assets/images/blocks/block-models/paper_bag_side_gusset.png"
        style="background-color: rgb(0,0,0,0.15);"
        pixelated
        width="128"
    />

These can be imported into Blockbench and then dragged onto each appropriate block face, although they likely won't look quite right...

## Rearranging UVs

To get textures into the right positions, you may need to reposition/resize your faces' UV mapping.
This can be done by selecting the affected face and using the UV panel.

## Changing Material Instances

Applying custom material instance names can be used to easily define how certain faces are rendered.

They can be edited by right-clicking on a cube and opening `Edit Material Instances`

![](/assets/images/blocks/block-models/select_edit_material_instances.png)

For the "paper_bag" model, the east and west faces should have their own texture.
We can indicate this by giving them a material instance.

## Applying Geometry & Textures

Once exported from `File > Export > Export Bedrock Geometry` into your `RP/models/blocks` folder, you can reference a model in your block JSON.

Then, textures can be applied by material instances through their `RP/textures/terrian_texture.json` shortname.

:::warning BLOCKS.JSON
Adding [`minecraft:geometry`](/blocks/block-components#geometry) to your block will cause the game to ignore texture definitions in `RP/blocks.json`.

If you have textures for your block defined in that file, make sure you move them to [`minecraft:material_instances`](/blocks/block-components#material-instances) for them to appear.
