        <CodeHeader>minecraft:block</CodeHeader>

        ```json
        "components": {
            "minecraft:friction": 0.4,
            "wiki:custom_component": {
                "parameter": "value"

-   Added `minecraft:movable`
    -   Determines how a block can be moved by pistons.
    -   Contains `movement_type` which can be one of the following values: `immovable`, `popped`, `push` or `push_pull` (default).
    -   Contains `sticky` which can be set to `same` to replicate Slime/Honey Block functionality.
-   Added `minecraft:random_offset`
    -   Causes a random offset to be applied to the block based on its position in the world
    -   Affects the block's collision box, selection box and geometry.
    -   Contains `x`, `y` and `z` which determine the possible offsets via the following parameters:
        -   `range` which is a [range object](/documentation/shared-constructs#range-objects) that determines how large offsets can be on each axis.
        -   `steps` which determines how many equally-spaced random values can be chosen across the `range`.
            -   A value of `0` means that any value within the `range` can be used.
