### AFK Detector Animation Controller

<Button link="animation-controllers-intro">Learn more about Animation Controllers</Button>

Here's an example that can be used to track AFK players.

<CodeHeader>BP/animation_controllers/afk.ac.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "format_version": "1.10.0",
    "animation_controllers": {
        "controller.animation.player.afk": {
            "states": {
                "default": {
                    "transitions": [
                        {
                            "stands_still": "!q.is_moving"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "stands_still": {
                    "on_entry": ["v.afk = q.life_time;"],
                    "transitions": [
                        {
                            "afk": "(q.life_time - v.afk) >= 30 && !q.is_moving"
                        },
                        {
                            "default": "q.is_moving"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "afk": {
                    "on_entry": ["/tag @s add AFK", "/say I'm now AFK"],
                    "animations": ["afk_animation"],
                    "transitions": [
                        {
                            "default": "q.is_moving"
                        }
                    ],
                    "on_exit": ["/tag @s remove AFK", "/say I'm no longer AFK"]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

-   "controller.animation.player.afk" is, of course, the identifier.
-   If the [Molang](https://bedrock.dev/r/MoLang) query `!q.is_moving` returns false (the player isn't moving), the state transits to the "stand_still" state.
-   "stand_still" state checks if player doesn't move in 30 seconds to transmit to "afk", if not return to "default"
-   When the state "afk" gets entered, "on_entry" gets triggered, which runs the following slash commands.
-   "animations" includes the Behavior Animation's shortname that is to be ran during the whole time the state is active, just like in [Resource Animation Controllers](#animation-controller).
-   If the player is moving again, the state will transit to "default" again.
    The commands "on_exit" will be executed.
